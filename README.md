# This is the official GoogleBot code that is updated to Heroku

Please do not copy this code, you kinda don't have the right to, as I haven't published a License file yet, so if you copy this you are kinda gonna be charged with copyright crap and all that, so pelase don't copy this please, if this falls into the wrong hands.

lmao this is a private repo stupid, abd besides, this is on github, so it's free use most of the time, they just can't copy googlebot entirely and claim it as their own

i mean most peole just wander in and copy it


ITS A PRIVATE REPOSITORY NOBODY CAN COME IN WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT

yeah but like if it was a public repo peple would just come in and copy it thats why i made it private
